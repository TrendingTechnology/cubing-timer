### Developer Additional Thought

This is just a project I created for myself to learn more about [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) as well as gain more experience in development. I have previously started a similar  project in June 2019 (hidden from Github at this point in time) but it was paused due to exams and other committements. This is a restucture of that project and reuse some components from previous project as well as what I have learnt to create a project with better file stucture as well as feature that I did not know exist back in the time.


Finish product will unlikely as polish as [csTimer](http://cstimer.net/) or [Timiks](https://timiks.com/), but I will try my best, welcome to leaves any issues or give me suggestions :)

Good Luck Cubing :)
